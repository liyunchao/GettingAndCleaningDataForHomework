## 2.Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
features  : file features.txt
col.idx : column index of mean or std activity

## 3.Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
activity.labels  : file activity_labels.txt

## 4.Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
get x data set of column index, assgin to target.x

## 5.From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
x.mean.group.by.label : mean of X.txt group by (y,subject)
